1. Verify all regex in config file as to its validity, to avoid runtime errors: 
   
   try:
      re.compile(*regex statement*)
      is_valid = true
   except re.error
      is_valid = false

   Priority: HIGH

2. Verify that any monitoring names or other keys actually exist in the API response to avoid runtime errors. Priority: HIGH

DONE 021119: 3. Move all configuration items (e.g. API endpoint, etc) into a configuration file under $nagios_mediator_home/config, rather than in the code

DONE 020819: 4. File paths as part of config file as well, rather than in the code (../log, ../config, etc)

5. More testing to break metric configuration file to ensure avoidance of runtime errors. Priority: HIGH

6. Better error handling if the API endpoint doesn't respond, or generates an error (e.g. invalid API key), also add timeout. Priority: HIGH

DONE 021519: 7. Warnings and errors to log file rather than stdout

8. Syntax checking and properties verification in nagios_config.txt configuration file. Priority: HIGH

9. Provide "un-webify" and "un-escape" response options (e.g., convert "&amp;" to "&" and "\/" to "/"). Priority: LOW

10. Documentation. Priority: HIGH

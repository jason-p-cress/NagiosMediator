1. Verify all regex in config file as to its validity:
   
   try:
      re.compile(*regex statement*)
      is_valid = true
   except re.error
      is_valid = false

2. Verify that any monitoring names or other keys actually exist in the API response to avoid runtime errors

3. Move all configuration items into a configuration file under $nagios_mediator_home/config

4. File paths as part of config file

5. More testing to break metric configuration file to avoid runtime errors

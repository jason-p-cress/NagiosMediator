1. Verify all regex in config file as to its validity, to avoid runtime errors:
   
   try:
      re.compile(*regex statement*)
      is_valid = true
   except re.error
      is_valid = false

2. Verify that any monitoring names or other keys actually exist in the API response to avoid runtime errors

DONE 021119: 3. Move all configuration items (e.g. API endpoint, etc) into a configuration file under $nagios_mediator_home/config, rather than in the code

DONE 020819: 4. File paths as part of config file as well, rather than in the code (../log, ../config, etc)

5. More testing to break metric configuration file to ensure avoidance of runtime errors

6. Better error handling if the API endpoint doesn't respond, or generates an error (e.g. invalid API key), also add timeout

7. Warnings and errors to log file rather than stdout
